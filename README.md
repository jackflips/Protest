Protest

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackflips/Protest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackflips/Protest)

Prototype of a peer to peer protest organizing application that allows protestors to communicate and coordinate with each other anonymously, without having to fight to be heard.

Protest uses ad hoc wifi and bluetooth to communicate between devices, so it is still functional even if the police or an oppresive regime were to [shut down cell towers](http://wapo.st/1jdfMUY).
